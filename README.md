 Global Temperature Anomaly Detection  
**Capstone Project â€“ DataTalent Program**

## Overview

This project explores global temperature anomalies using time series analysis, statistical anomaly detection, and supervised machine learning. Developed as part of the DataTalent Capstone Program, the goal was to identify significant deviations in climate patterns, model long-term temperature trends, and visualize the results using real-world climate data.

## Dataset

- **Global Temperature Anomalies**  
  Monthly surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2023, sourced from Kaggle and the HadCRUT5 ensemble dataset.  
  Formats include CSV and NetCDF.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Statsmodels  
- Xarray (for NetCDF data)  
- Azure ML Studio  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Time Series Analysis: rolling averages, stationarity testing, seasonal decomposition  
- Anomaly Detection: S-H-ESD  
- Supervised ML: Linear Regression, Decision Tree  
- Geospatial Data Handling: NetCDF via Azure ML Studio

## Key Results

- Detected statistically significant anomalies in global temperature trends  
- Regression models approximated long-term shifts with varying accuracy  
- Rolling averages and decomposition revealed persistent warming phases  
- Ensemble mean data supports future geospatial climate modeling
