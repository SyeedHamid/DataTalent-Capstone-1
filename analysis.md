Project Analysis:**


This project analyzes global temperature anomaly data to uncover meaningful shifts in climate behavior over time. Using the HadCRUT4 dataset, we applied statistical smoothing, seasonal decomposition, and machine learning regression to:
- Identify long-term warming trends and short-term volatility
- Detect abrupt month-over-month temperature shifts
- Quantify seasonal variability across decades
- Train and compare multiple regression models to predict anomalies
- Visualize feature importance to understand temporal influence


**Key findings:**
- Ensemble models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) outperformed simpler regressors, achieving RÂ² scores above 0.88
- Year had a stronger predictive influence than Month, confirming the dominance of long-term warming
- The top 10 anomaly shifts were distributed across the century, showing that short-term climate volatility is not a recent phenomenon
This analysis lays the groundwork for more advanced forecasting and anomaly detection, with real-world applications in climate policy, environmental planning, and risk modeling.
